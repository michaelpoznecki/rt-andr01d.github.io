		For anyone who doesnt know me personally, you should know I love coffee. Maybe a little too much.
		I wouldnt say I am the most addicted coffee drinker. In fact I am far fom it. When I was younger, 
		I absolutely hated coffee as most children do. All we want is something sweet or salty. Tasting cofee,
		as I used to put it, "tasted like drinking bricks". This is usually due to trying my father's
		black coffee with just a small ammount of creamer in it. Even to this day I cannot ever recommend
		using creamer in black coffee. it just makes it worse.

		As i started college, and had to stay up late doing homework and labs, I thought I could get by
		without coffee. But I still remember the day I decided to try coffee, and it changed my life.
		This is how it goes for most people if you ask them about how they started drinking coffee. 
		Everything from "I had to to stay awake for school" to "I had a child".
