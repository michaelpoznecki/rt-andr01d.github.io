		Recently I have been caught up doing tons of homework for College, and have had little time	
		to do any research for myself. Between the homeworks and Hack the Box challenges, the one topic
		which continues to grab my attention is Active Directory and abusing privileges on the Domain.
		Two tools which have been my main focus are PowerSploit and Mimikatz. I have already done prese-
		ntations for my Red Team at school about the two tools, but I want to look deeper and learn how 
		or why these really work. Hopefully by the end of this blog post I will have explaing Mimikatz 
		enough to understand how the modules work and why they work.

		PowerSploit is a powerful tool when used correctly. I have run across using it in two seperate
		ack The Box machines, each of which gave me privilege escelation. The Priv Esc module can be
		sed to scan for processes that are running that you can write to. This means you can execute
		command as youd like without any other work.
