	This will be my first deep dive into hacking Active Directory - so give me a chance. My first
	task: understand how mimikatz does what it does. Incase you dont know, mimikatz is a tool written 
	by Benjamin DEPLY or @gentilkiwi on twitter. According to the github README.md file, mimikatz
	was originally written to learn c and do experiments on Windows security. Well, he did a fine
	job as it is now one of the most used tools for exploiting Active Directory.
