	Iv been doing Red Teaming / Pentesting for a while now, just not formally. Currently in college I am part of the Red Team that helps
	train a Blue Team for the CCDC (Collegic Cyber Defense Competition) competition. I have also been participating in the CPTC (Collegic Penetration Testing Competition)
	meetings. I recently recieved an opportunity for intern for the company [redacted] in [redacted], doing penetration testing.
	I happen to be good friends with one of the PenTesters there, and thought it might be a good idea to ask about what I should
	study up on. The answer was not at all surprising.
</p>
<p>
	I have known for quite some time that the majority of corporate networks run on Active Directory or Microsoft Azure, but
	it has never really come up in my quest to learn more "hacker" skills. One resource I use often is Hack The Box, which
	if you have not heard of it and want to get into pentesting, I highly recommend. Its a bit fun just to get an invite to
	the site, as you have to hack your way in. There are walkthroughs available but I suggest you attempt it alone first.
	When I asked about what I should focus on leading up to the internship, he replied something along the lines of
	"Active Directory. Learn Blood Hound and Impaket." Iv been meaning to get this personal security blog up and running
	for a while now, and I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to blog about my learning. Since I will be blogging
	while I learn, some points may be abstruded, so I do appologize.
</p>
<p>
	First things first, set up a domain. There are AD ranges available like on Hack The Box, however these ranges are expensive
	to operate and thus require a huge charge to have access. Back in highschool, gaming was something I held dear to my heart.
	As I got into college, the passion started to die, and the machine was only powered on every now and then when I was having 
	a bad day. Since I needed a range for the Domain and did not want to run a domain fully inside its own vm, I decided to go
	ahead and install VMware ESXI on the pc. After that, setting up the domain was easy enough. The hardest part of the setup
	was waiting for things to initialize and install. 
</p>
<p>
	Heres a basic description of how I set up the Domain: A Windows Server 2012 with Active Directory installed, a backup Admin account
	called david, and a Windows 10 VM connected to the domain so it can authenticate through the domain. I want to set up a few extra
	domains and misconfigurations. Misconfiguring something is a way to both learn how not to configure something, and lerning 
	paths of exploitation. There are two resources I know of which have proven helpful in the past when it comes to AD security.
	harmj0y.net is a website written by the Will of SpecterOps. He has had his hand in the creation of a framework I know and love, and
	one I've heard of but never used. Empire and BloodHound are two extremely useful tools which I hope to touch on sometime in this
	learning path. The other resource is adsecurity.org which is owned and written by Sean metcalf who is a leader in security for 
	Active Directory. Hopefully we will all learn alot about Active Directory throught this blog thread.
