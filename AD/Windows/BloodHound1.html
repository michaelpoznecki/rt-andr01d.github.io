	Active Directory is used in most corporate environments you will come across. Domains can
	usually span quite a large area and contain many computers and forests. This can mean it can be
	a bit overwhelming trying to get an idea of what the topology of the Domain looks like. Thankfully,
	there is a tool built for exactly this. Bloodhound is a tool which can be used to enumerate
	domain trusts and account privileges, and give a graphical overview of what the domain looks
	like and paths to domain admin.

	some that are memebers of groups which are parts of other groups.
