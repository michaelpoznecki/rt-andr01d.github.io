			<p>
				This whole project started out as a ctf on vulnhub.com. Initially, I was doing it for the red team,

			<p>
				Recently I have been caught up doing tons of homework for College, and have had little time
				to do any research for myself. Between the homeworks and Hack the Box challenges, the one topic
				which continues to grab my attention is Active Directory and abusing privileges on the Domain.
				Two tools which have been my main focus are PowerSploit and Mimikatz. I have already done prese-
				ntations for my Red Team at school about the two tools, but I want to look deeper and learn how 
				or why these really work. Hopefully by the end of this blog post I will have explaing Mimikatz 
				enough to understand how the modules work and why they work.
