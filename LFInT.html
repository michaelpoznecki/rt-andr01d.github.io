<h1> LFInT Writeup </h1>

<body>
    This whole project started out as a ctf on vulnhub.com. Initially, I was doing it for the red team,
    which had decided every week we needed a new vulnhub finished. No biggie so far, had two under my belt.
    This one was different though. I was reading through several walkthroughs and gathering information on 
    how local file inclusion vulnerabilities worked. I had recalled several months ago I had stumbled upon
    a writeup on someone who wrote a shell that was able to interface with a file listing script stuck
    on a website. This gave me the idea to create a shell which would interface with the file inclusion,
    effectively giving a full shell, going off the basis that you could read a certain file, and run commands
    which would be printed to that file.
